              &emsp;&emsp; After twelve months of living with the continuous
              lingering fear of COVID-19, and vaccines that are yet to be widely
              distributed, or even prove very effective, the pandemic seems far
              from over. However, there are certain takeaways that the Pandemic
              has given many people a new look on life and a way to better their
              lives as well.

              &emsp;&emsp; For starters, for some people the pandemic might have
              helped them save money over the course of the last year. For
              instance, instead of going to restaurants, many have stayed home
              and cooked their own meals. Considering the hundreds of dollars
              that individual families spend at restaurants in a given week,
              this equates to saving thousands of dollars over the last year.
              Not only with homelife, but during the pandemic, we have seen more
              companies transition for their employees to work from home. From a
              company’s standpoint, from allowing their employees to work from
              home, this allowed them to indepthly understand the true number of
              people and positions needed to operate. Meaning that unnecessary
              expenditures on items such as materials, utilities, and sadly even
              salaries could be greatly trimmed to help the profitability of the
              company. And while this might be bad for individual employees, it
              can have a better effect for the consumer, as the product can
              become cheaper because of a lesser cost for both materials and
              labor.

              &emsp;&emsp; Not only economically, but also socially, the
              pandemic has shown us that as humans we require and want
              interaction. For many schools and universities that have gone all
              virtual or use multiple methods such as a “hybrid” (where students
              attend in-person on certain days and virtually on the others)
              paired with virtual and full in-person, this creates much stress
              among students. Both the stress and lower grades that many
              students obtain show that virtual schooling is likely to not be a
              long term solution for schooling. Instead, with the hope of the
              vaccine being effective, many schools are pushing for more
              in-person classes. This is because in-person forces most students
              to be more accountable and more responsible to do their work.

              &emsp;&emsp; Not just socially and economically, the pandemic has
              affected our lives in many different ways. Some for the better,
              and some for the worse. But with each day, we just need to keep
              pushing forward as a society, and remember to always try and do
              our best, no matter what circumstances we find ourselves in.
